Input:
First line of input contains an integer , denoting no of streets in the city.
Details for each street is described in next two lines.
First line contains two integers  and  denoting no of buildings in the Street and earning on communicating with a building.
Second line contains  integers, denoting height of  building.
C++ implementation:

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	long long num, n_building,earn,count=0,h_seen,m;
	cin>>num;
	for(int i=0;i<num;i++){
		cin>>n_building;
		cin>>earn;
		long long arr[n_building];
	for(int j=0;j<n_building;j++){
		cin>>arr[j];
	}
	for(m=0;m<n_building;m++){
		if(arr[m]>0.5){
			h_seen = arr[m];
			count=1;
			break;
		}
	}

	for(int i=m; i<n_building;i++){
		if (arr[i]>h_seen){
			h_seen = arr[i];
			count++;
		}
	}
	cout<<count*earn<<endl;


	}	
}
